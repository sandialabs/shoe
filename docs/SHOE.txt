Building SHOE
-------------

At this point, SHOE requires a number of external libraries. Hey, it's research code.
You will need
- LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage, http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)
- BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, http://www.netlib.org/blas/)
- GiNaC (GiNaC Is Not A CAS, http://www.ginac.de/)
- CLN (Class Library for Numbers, http://www.ginac.de/CLN/)
- gsl (the GNU Scientific Library, http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/)
- Qt (http://trolltech.com/)

Some libraries that SHOE needs are included with vtkSNL because of their
small size and/or relative obscurity:
- pss (Polynomial System Solver)
- vtkQt

Optionally, if you want to build the finite element solver (not checked in
at this point, but coming soon to a CVS archive near you), you'll need
- Octave (http://www.octave.org/)

NOTE: LAPACK_EXTRA_LIBRARIES should be set (on Linux) to include the
	FORTRAN math and support libraries. On Red Hat 8.0, this would be
	LAPACK_EXTRA_LIBRARIES="/usr/lib/libgcc_s.so /usr/lib/libg2c.so.0.0.0"

Grokking SHOE
-------------

If you *really* want to grok SHOE, read the source. If you're
the type that likes to RTFM see the technical report in this
directory named SAND2004-1617.pdf.
